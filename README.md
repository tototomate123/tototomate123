# 👋 Hey, I'm Louis

## 🧑‍💻 About Me
I'm an 11th-grade student with a passion for **informatics** and a love for **coding**. <!--Together with a friend, we're in the progress of developing a programming language called **Quark**, which combines features from TypeScript, Rust, and Go, aiming for power, speed, and familiarity. -->

I enjoy working on a wide range of projects, from **backend development** to **compiler design**. My current interests revolve around creating **efficient programming tools**, working with **WebSockets**, and exploring **AI**.


### 💡 Fun Facts
- **Music Enthusiast**: I love listening to music - you can listen to my top tracks at [louiscreates.com](https://louiscreates.com).
- **Tech Setup**: Running a dual-boot setup, with my main OS being **Arch Linux** *with an NVIDIA GPU (its working great...)*. If I use Windows, its only for gaming.
